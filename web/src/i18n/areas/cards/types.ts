/**
 * Cards copy — ticket 11 I5.
 *
 * ONE AREA PER DIRECTORY, and this directory is owned by whoever is converting
 * `web/src/features/cards/`. Nothing outside it should be edited to add a
 * string here: that is the whole reason the catalog is split this way, so six
 * people can convert six features at once without meeting in one file.
 *
 * The rules, restated because this is where they get broken:
 *
 *   - The path is the id. Name a leaf for what it *is* on the screen, never
 *     for what it says. `emptyState.title`, not `belumAdaCatatan`.
 *   - A string with a value in it is a function, so its arity is typechecked
 *     and `Intl.PluralRules` stays in the language that has plurals.
 *   - A list is a tuple, so a translation that drops one fails the build.
 *   - `en` is *translated from* `id`, not written against the screen. Same
 *     claims, same order. Nothing added because an English sentence wanted one
 *     more clause, nothing dropped because it read awkwardly.
 *   - Never punitive (hard rule 6). English has a far larger vocabulary of
 *     gentle blame than Indonesian, and `catalog.test.ts` fails on a list of
 *     it. No "don't forget", no "you missed", no "keep your streak".
